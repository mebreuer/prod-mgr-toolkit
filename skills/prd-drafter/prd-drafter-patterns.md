## Domain Knowledge
<!-- Patterns about specific product domains, user segments, or business context -->

## Common Problem Shapes
<!-- Recurring problem structures that help calibrate exploration depth -->

## Effective Questions
<!-- Questions that consistently unlocked deeper problem understanding -->

## Research Sources
<!-- WebSearch queries, Dovetail projects, or Preset dashboards that proved valuable -->

## Solution Patterns
<!-- Recurring solution approaches or architectural patterns worth remembering -->

## Anti-Patterns
<!-- Approaches that looked good on paper but failed in practice, or common drafting mistakes -->
