# PRD Patterns - Living Memory

This file is read at the start of each PRD enhancement run and updated at the end. It accumulates domain knowledge, common gaps, useful data sources, and effective review questions across runs.

## Domain Knowledge
<!-- Patterns about specific product domains, user segments, or business context -->

## Common PRD Gaps
<!-- Recurring gaps found across PRDs — helps prioritize review focus -->

## Useful Data Sources
<!-- Preset dashboards, Dovetail projects, or other sources that proved valuable -->

## Effective Review Questions
<!-- Questions that consistently surfaced important gaps or insights -->

## Solution Patterns
<!-- Recurring solution approaches, architectural patterns, or design decisions -->

## Anti-Patterns
<!-- Approaches that looked good on paper but failed in practice -->
